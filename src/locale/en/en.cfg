orbital-ion-cannon=Launching Orbital Ion Cannons from your rocket silo(s) is the ultimate method of dealing with alien infestations. Using their immense firepower, you can clear vast swaths of hostile territory and open up more room for expanding your factory. The more Ion Cannons you launch, the more frequently you will be able to make use of their powerful blasts.
orbital-ion-cannon-space-travel=Install Orbital Ion Cannons on your space platform(s) is the ultimate method of dealing with alien infestations. Using their immense firepower, you can clear vast swaths of hostile territory and open up more room for expanding your factory. The more Ion Cannons you install, the more frequently you will be able to make use of their powerful blasts.
orbital-ion-cannon-area-fire=Researching Area Fire enables your ion cannons to destroy an entire area with simultanenous blasts. The more Ion Cannons you launch, the larger areas can be destroyed simultanenous.
auto-targeting=Researching Auto-Targeting enables your radars to designate enemy nests as targets for your Orbital Ion Cannons automatically, during the course of their regular scanning. Additionally, any new biter nest expansions in the always-visible regions around your radars can be automatically detected and an ion cannon blast will make short work of them.
orbital-ion-cannon-mk2=Launching Orbital Ion Cannons from your rocket silo(s) is the ultimate method of dealing with alien infestations. Using their immense firepower, you can clear vast swaths of hostile territory and open up more room for expanding your factory. The more Ion Cannons you launch, the more frequently you will be able to make use of their powerful blasts.
orbital-ion-cannon-mk2-space-travel=Build even more powerful Orbital Ion Cannons on your space platform(s) is the ultimate method of dealing with alien infestations. Using their immense firepower, you can clear vast swaths of hostile territory and open up more room for expanding your factory. The more Ion Cannons you install, the more frequently you will be able to make use of their powerful blasts.  You need to finish reserach Mk2 upgrade to install them.
orbital-ion-cannon-mk2-upgrade=During this research, all existing Ion Cannon Mk1s are upgraded to Mk2s. Once the research is complete, only Mk2s can be built.

ion-cannon-cooldown-seconds=The cooldown time for each orbital ion cannon, in seconds.
ion-cannon-voice-style=Choose which announcer voice you would like. Your options are: "CommandAndConquer" - the original C&C from 1995, "TiberianSunEVA" - C&C: Tiberian Sun EVA, "TiberianSunCABAL" - C&C: Tiberian Sun CABAL.
ion-cannon-play-voices=Play the announcer voices from Command & Conquer.
ion-cannon-voice-volume=The percent volume of the announcer voice between 0 and 100.
ion-cannon-play-klaxon=Play a klaxon sound whenever a target for an ion cannon is designated.
ion-cannon-klaxon-volume=The percent volume of the klaxon between 0 and 100.
ion-cannon-radius=The radius of the ion cannon's blast.
ion-cannon-laser-damage=How much laser damage is dealt in one ion cannon blast.
ion-cannon-explosion-damage=How much explosion damage is dealt in one ion cannon blast.
ion-cannon-heatup-multiplier=This multiplier affects how long it takes for an ion cannon to fire after a target has been designated. The default value of 2 results in approximately 7 seconds between target designation and ion cannon blast. This is a linear multiplier, so a value of 10 would result in about 35 seconds between targeting and blast. It is not recommended to set this value too high (it was only tested out to a value of 10).
ion-cannon-auto-targeting=Toggle Auto-Targeting using long-distance radar scanning on/off.
ion-cannon-target-worms=Whether Auto-Targeting should target worms as well as nests.
ion-cannon-auto-target-visible=Toggle Auto-Targeting of new nest expansions within the always-revealed regions around radar coverage. Beware: Enemy expansion in close proximity to your structures can result in friendly fire.
ion-cannon-custom-alerts=Enable custom alerts that activate whenever an ion cannon target is designated.
ion-cannon-flames=Choose whether ion cannon blasts ignite everything within the blast radius, resulting in patches of flame that may spread wildfires.
ion-cannon-ready-ticks=The number of gameticks that must pass between consecutive "Ion cannon ready" announcements. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 300 ticks would be 5 seconds.
ion-cannon-bob-updates=If true, this mod will update its recipes and technologies to include new, high-tier items from Bob's Electronics, Tech, Warfare, and/or Power mods.
ion-cannon-chart-tag-duration=How long the map markers for ion cannon targets will last before being deleted, measured in gameticks. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 720 ticks would be 12 seconds -- 5 seconds beyond the default time of 7 seconds from target designation to blast impact.
ion-cannon-min-cannons-ready=The minimum number of ready-to-fire cannons required before any targets will be auto-designated. This lets you have a buffer of ion cannons that will always be available for manual targeting.
ion-cannon-cheat-menu=Display a cheat menu in the mod dialog that allows you to add ion cannons into orbit for free.
ion-cannon-early-recipe=The research is possible earlier
ion-cannon-1x1-controler=Uses a 1x1 controller instead of the 3x3 controller
